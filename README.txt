To-do priorities:

Expedite -> Create Localhost API that calls API gateway dev API.

1. Hide minutes page (tab) when a meeting hasn't been clicked on the LHS
2. Need to finish minutes page (loading, adding and updating)
3. Updating a meeting doesn't refresh the meeting list - needs to happen.
4. Order history from latest date descending order
5. Add a search feature on History table
6. Add a 'Tag' or 'Label' field to Meeting page - this will enable the grouping of meetings
7. Need to add a 'remove account/profile' feature
