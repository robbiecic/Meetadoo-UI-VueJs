To-do priorities:

1. Make width of text fields in login screen smaller
2. Make width of text fields in register screen smaller (same width as above)
3. After login successful, it doesn't need to run a get profile...
4. Replace 'Latest Release' in header with the user's name and icon which takes them to their profile page
5. When Adding or Updating a meeting, need to show a success or Fail alert
6. Need to finish minutes page (loading, adding and updating)
7. Disable minutes page (tab) when a meeting hasn't been clicked on the LHS
8. Updating a meeting doesn't refresh the meeting list - needs to happen.
9. Order history from latest date descending order
10. Add a search feature on History table
11. Add a 'Tag' or 'Label' field to Meeting page - this will enable the grouping of meetings
12. Need to add a 'remove account/profile' feature
