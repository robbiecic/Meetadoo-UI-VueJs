To-do priorities:

1. Need to finish minutes page (loading, adding and updating)
2. Updating a meeting doesn't refresh the meeting list - needs to happen (reproduce by adding participants but after update, if you re-click it the updated particpants don't show)
3. Order history from latest date descending order
4. Add a search feature on History table
5. Add a 'Tag' or 'Label' field to Meeting page - this will enable the grouping of meetings
6. Need to add a 'remove account/profile' feature
