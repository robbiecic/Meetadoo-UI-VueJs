To-do priorities:

Expedite -> Create Localhost API that calls API gateway dev API.

1. When Adding or Updating a meeting, need to show a success or Fail alert
2. Need to finish minutes page (loading, adding and updating)
3. Disable minutes page (tab) when a meeting hasn't been clicked on the LHS
4. Updating a meeting doesn't refresh the meeting list - needs to happen.
5. Order history from latest date descending order
6. Add a search feature on History table
7. Add a 'Tag' or 'Label' field to Meeting page - this will enable the grouping of meetings
8. Need to add a 'remove account/profile' feature
