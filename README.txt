To-do priorities:


Selected:
- Review Updated lifecycle hook instead of Created and Watching prop changes
- Actions page
    - List of all the actions in your meetings. Can filter by assignee or tags. Clicked tag from top banner which applies the filter.
- Landing page to show upcoming actions, overdue actions etc. Day at glance, upcoming meetings etc
    - Show number of actions assigned to you after clicking, goes to actions page
    - Banner showing all labels, when clicked filters the page for the meetings with those labels only
    - Can easily jump to add meetings and minutes
- By clicking a tag in your meetings, you can see all the meetings and actions
- Ticking on action doesn't do anything
- Order my meetings API in date descending order


Backlog:
- Need to add a 'remove account/profile' feature
- Actions can be starred, High, Medium, Low, created_date
- Change owner(s) of meeting
- Need to think about permissions
- Take a look at Microsoft to do functionality
- Need the ability to create a meeting group and linked meetings to it
- We want clone an existing meeting which would be useful for recurring meetings. Easy way to copy over the attendees
