To-do priorities:

- Add a search feature on History table
- Disable fields on minutes page (tab) when a meeting hasn't been clicked on the LHS / created
- Need to finish minutes page (loading, adding and updating)
- Order history from latest date descending order
- Add a 'Tag' or 'Label' field to Meeting page - this will enable the grouping of meetings
- Need to add a 'remove account/profile' feature
