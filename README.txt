To-do priorities:

1. - Use vuetify Cards to show meetings on LHS, and grids to split LHS & RHS



Backlog:
- Minutes API - will need a load last 10, load all, load single - deail API compatability
- Use inifity loading to load calendar cards on scroll. Maybe only loads last 10?
- Use Vuetify skelton loaders instead of spinners
- Vuetify Badges to show actions assigned to a user
