To-do priorities:

Expedite -> Create Localhost API that calls API gateway dev API.

1. Replace 'Latest Release' in header with the user's name and icon which takes them to their profile page
2. When Adding or Updating a meeting, need to show a success or Fail alert
3. Need to finish minutes page (loading, adding and updating)
4. Disable minutes page (tab) when a meeting hasn't been clicked on the LHS
5. Updating a meeting doesn't refresh the meeting list - needs to happen.
6. Order history from latest date descending order
7. Add a search feature on History table
8. Add a 'Tag' or 'Label' field to Meeting page - this will enable the grouping of meetings
9. Need to add a 'remove account/profile' feature
