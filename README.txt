To-do priorities:

1. After login successful, it doesn't need to run a get profile...
2. Replace 'Latest Release' in header with the user's name and icon which takes them to their profile page
3. When Adding or Updating a meeting, need to show a success or Fail alert
4. Need to finish minutes page (loading, adding and updating)
5. Disable minutes page (tab) when a meeting hasn't been clicked on the LHS
6. Updating a meeting doesn't refresh the meeting list - needs to happen.
7. Order history from latest date descending order
8. Add a search feature on History table
9. Add a 'Tag' or 'Label' field to Meeting page - this will enable the grouping of meetings
10. Need to add a 'remove account/profile' feature
